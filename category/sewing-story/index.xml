I hear this question for the hundredth time. So I breathe out quietly in a meditative manner and with a mysterious smile, I answer that I’m sewing neither one nor the other.
After all, I know that in a dozen stitches I will finish the bohemian kimono, which I have wanted for many years.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat?

There I described the fabrics &amp;amp; techniques I used to give this coat shape &amp;amp; support.
And now my hands are burning, because it's time to draw a pattern for the inner structure.
The Interfacing Patterns I do not print the details of the inner structure in advance, so I place tracing paper on top of the pattern and draw new contours.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat?

Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. I need a sweater, and a hat and a scarf, and a sweater, yes, it will be warmer.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

Be my guest and enjoy.

*“Stripes are always in fashion, but now especially aggressive ones.” Horizontal and vertical at the same time, wide and narrow in super-bright colours.“*
Wrote the Vogue magazine on top of the vivid photos from the shows of Fendi, Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler in an article about the fashion trends of the upcoming 2017 year.
Snow is already falling in the morning, the sun gently shines through the window &amp;amp; it’s cold.</description></item></channel></rss>
