Pattern Shapes Here you can see a 5-piece Basic Block for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front &amp;amp; Back Bodice pieces, Front &amp;amp; Back skirt pieces &amp;amp; a wrist-length set-in sleeve.
From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations.</description></item><item><title>01. The Block Patterns</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/01-block-patterns/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/01-block-patterns/</guid><description>In the previous introduction post, I briefly wrote about two main stages of patternmaking that lead you from an idea to a beautiful dress: the Basic Block &amp;amp; Flat Patternmaking. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out what the first one is.
Block Patterns are the basic shapes which are later transformed into new garment designs.
You might find them not only in the apparel field but in bag, shoes &amp;amp; many other fields, which I know nothing about.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</guid><description>Every dress starts with an idea. You might see the perfect one in a magazine, on a young &amp;amp; fresh girl who just walked out of a high-end fashion boutique or you might get lightened with inspiration in a fabric store when you see that silk organza with velvet dots.
Usually, when I get this sudden idea of a dress which &amp;ldquo;I-do-want-right-now-but-I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-why&amp;rdquo;, I wait for a couple of days - and that&amp;rsquo;s a really hard process - and if this dress still sits somewhere in the back of my head, that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to sew it.</description></item><item><title>The Renovation</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/the-renovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/the-renovation/</guid><description>The Prologue It’s been a really long time since I wrote the last post here. I can’t even remember when &amp;amp; what it was. It’s not like I had nothing to say, I just guess I’m not the person who can tell a whole novel about going to a grocery shop. But sometimes projects or events, that are worth mentioning, happen. That’s why there are times of stillness here in this Journal.</description></item><item><title>Bows &amp; Flowers.

Prologue A magical commercial or I’d better say, a short-film by Gucci inspired me to draw a couple of illustrations. That film tells a story about a man &amp;amp; two girls, who spend their time in mystic &amp;amp; foggy Venice. The city is empty, everything is blurred &amp;amp; tainted with gold &amp;amp; foggy grey colours.</description></item><item><title>Lace &amp; Embroidered Fabric. Part 2. Techniques for Sewing</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/lace-and-embroidered-fabric-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/lace-and-embroidered-fabric-part-2/</guid><description>There are no certain rules for every exact lace because everything depends on the tread type, the background &amp;amp; overall quality, but there are some common guides for all laces.
Pattern choice When choosing the pattern &amp;amp; design let the fabric determine what it’ll be like. Don’t pull &amp;amp; force it or cut it into multiple pattern pieces, that can destroy the motifs. Let the fabric show its beauty.
For laconiс fitted silhouettes use heavy laces like Alencon &amp;amp; Cluny.</description></item><item><title>Lace &amp; Embroidered Fabric. Part 1.

For the last reason, the fabric safely lay in the box for another year. Once a couple of months I took it out, chaotically draped on myself and without the desired result put it back. I knew it would be a dress, but what dress – that was the question.</description></item><item><title>Making of a Dress Form. Part 2. The Plaster Mold</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/making-of-a-dress-form-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/making-of-a-dress-form-part-2/</guid><description>When the praparation with all the materials, a place &amp;amp; a right pose for my future dress form was done, we were ready to get to the point.
We’ve decided, that the final plaster mould would consist of two layers: one horizontal &amp;amp; one vertical. Each layer would be made of 3 layers of plaster bandage. So, it will be 6 layers thick. This will make the mould firm enough to keep the shape &amp;amp; not get wet with moisture from papier-mache.</description></item><item><title>Making of a Dress Form. Part 1.

I saw it in my dreams, it tormented me by thoughts of the tops of draping, which I could conquer with it. The discrepancy between the desired and affordable option drove me into a week of melancholy.
The Options Time had passed, and I was still rushing from one option to another. I chose between a soft substandard dummy with short legs for a relatively adequate price and a firm one with a skirt and the shipping price, that cost as much as the dummy itself.</description></item><item><title>One More Kimono &amp; a Tulip Sleeve</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/one-more-kimono/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/one-more-kimono/</guid><description>Curious faces peer over my shoulder and ask what I am sewing: a silk robe or a negligee. I hear this question for the hundredth time. So I breathe out quietly in a meditative manner and with a mysterious smile, I answer that I’m sewing neither one nor the other.
After all, I know that in a dozen stitches I will finish the bohemian kimono, which I have wanted for many years.</description></item><item><title>Fashion Illustration in Design Process</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/illustration-in-design-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/illustration-in-design-process/</guid><description>Imagination takes you to distant cities, introduces to people from other continents and dresses you up in clothes that you have never worn before. If building a new city is problematic, and it is sometimes impossible to find strangers from the dream, sewing a dress is easy.
The main thing is to correctly translate the thought from the head to the fabric. I imagine this process as travelling by train from one city to another.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat? Part 2.</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</guid><description>In the previous post I wrote about the difference between interfacing &amp;amp; interlining. There I described the fabrics &amp;amp; techniques I used to give this coat shape &amp;amp; support.
And now my hands are burning, because it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw a pattern for the inner structure.
The Interfacing Patterns I do not print the details of the inner structure in advance, so I place tracing paper on top of the pattern and draw new contours.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat?

Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. I need a sweater, and a hat and a scarf, and a sweater, yes, it will be warmer.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

If you’ve just joined, feel free to start with Part 1, which tells about inspiration &amp;amp; preparatory process, &amp;amp; Part 2 – there you can read about patterns &amp;amp; samples.
Let’s continue!
7. Cutting the fashion fabric Well-done cutting also needs some rules:
The fabric needs pre-shrinking with heat or water beforehand, so that after the first wash the M-size blouse won’t unexpectedly turn into XXS.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

It tells about inspiration, ideas, ways of getting a pattern &amp;amp; measurements. If you please, I’ll continue.
4. Pattern A pattern is the template, the blueprint, from which the parts of a garment - like sleeves, front &amp;amp; back bodice, collar, etc. - are placed &amp;amp; traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. Patterns may be drafted manually or digitally.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

Unexpectedly, the choice that the magazines provided was not enough, and the decision to create a dress from the beginning to the end came by itself. This was the beginning of a new era.
At that moment, I was left alone with my knowledge, skills and a million doubts. There was nothing that could help, no trued pattern, no step-by-step instructions, or even a brief scheme.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

The first part of this story tells about the idea, that evolved into this beautiful skirt, its patternmaking process &amp;amp; cutting. So, if you missed it, please, click a link above.
Be my guest and enjoy.
Attaching the Interlining For interlining I choose the cambric, which, for some unknown reason, already lied in the closet.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

“Stripes are always in fashion, but now especially aggressive ones. Horizontal and vertical at the same time, wide and narrow in super-bright colours.“
Wrote the Vogue magazine on top of the vivid photos from the shows of Fendi, Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler in an article about the fashion trends of the upcoming 2017 year.
Snow is already falling in the morning, the sun gently shines through the window &amp;amp; it’s cold.</description></item></channel></rss>
