The Block Patterns</h1><p>In the previous <a href=/blog/introduction/>introduction post</a>, I briefly wrote about two main stages of patternmaking that lead you from an idea to a beautiful dress: the basic block &amp; flat patternmaking. Let&rsquo;s find out what the first one is.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Block Patterns</em></strong> <em>are the basic shapes which are later transformed into new garment designs.</em></p></blockquote><p>You might find them not only in the apparel field but in bag, shoes &amp; many other fields, which I know nothing about. So let&rsquo;s get back to clothing.</p><p>The Block Pattern section might be divided into 2 categories: <strong><em>The Basic Block</em></strong> <em>&amp;</em> <strong><em>the Fashion Block</em></strong>.</p><h2 id=the-basic-block>The Basic Block</h2><blockquote><p><strong><em>The Basic Block Pattern</em></strong> <em>- is a parent pattern, a foundation from which all other styles evolve. It is a well-fitting pattern that is pretty simple &amp; doesn&rsquo;t have any styling details. Usually, it has seam allowances, but some articles &amp; books tell the opposite.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Basic Block uses measurements of a company&rsquo;s fit model if speaking about the industry, or your body measurements if you make patterns for yourself. Apart from the measurements, the Basic Block contains a certain amount of <strong><em>ease</em></strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Ease</em></strong> <em>is the centimetres added to the body measurements in order to give us comfort for walking, breathing, raising our hands, eating - that will be wearing ease - or a certain silhouette - that is design ease.</em></p></blockquote><h3 id=types-of-basic-blocks>Types of Basic Blocks</h3><p>Most of the time the Basic Block has the minimal sufficient wearing ease.
But it is helpful if you have Basic blocks for <strong>different silhouettes</strong>.
The most common ones are:</p><ul><li><strong>Loose</strong> - for designs with a relaxed fit</li><li><strong>Semi-fitted</strong> like in a sheath dress<br></li><li><strong>Fitted</strong> for sleeveless designs or fabrics that stretch.</li></ul><p>I skip the last one &amp; transform the semi-fitted one into it usually.</p><p>Also, the Basic Blocks don&rsquo;t only differ in silhouettes, there are separate ones for <strong>different types of clothing</strong>:</p><ul><li>Dresses, Blouses &amp; Skirts<em>- in some systems they may share the same Basic Block, of which I&rsquo;m not a fan.</em></li><li>Pants</li><li>Jackets</li><li>Coats, etc.</li></ul><p>And I almost forgot to mention, that there are different Blocks for <strong>different fabrics</strong>: woven or knitted.</p><h3 id=where-to-get-one>Where to get one</h3><p>That sounds like a lot of work, but you don&rsquo;t need all of them right now. And you don&rsquo;t have to draft the Basic Block if you are not fond of math or drafting. There always are options:</p><ol><li>Order a Basic Block from <strong>a pattern maker</strong>. So you can be sure it is created according to your measurements &amp; body type.</li><li>Adapt <strong>the commercial sewing pattern</strong>. Some platforms or stores sell basic patterns without excess design detailing, some don&rsquo;t. In the first case, you&rsquo;ll need to find the one that matches your measurements in the best way. In the second compare the measurements &amp; try to find the pattern as close to the sheath dress, as possible.</li><li>Use <strong>online resources</strong> that create basic patterns according to your measurements &amp; the amount of ease desired.</li><li>It is my favourite: <strong>draft your own pattern yourself</strong>. Take some time to master a pattern-making course or study the manual - whatever works best for you will be great. Learn how to fly to feel free. Not literally, of course.</li></ol><p>Once you have your Basic Block you don&rsquo;t need to redraft it from beginning every time as long as your measurements remain the same. So, the more accurate the measurements and the fit of the Basic Block are, the better the future garments will fit &amp; the less fitting alterations you&rsquo;ll have.</p><p>My suggestion is to spend some time to make a cheap fabric toile of a Basic Block to check the proportions &amp; shape &amp; get rid of all fitting issues right at the start, so they won&rsquo;t bother you later. And then, when your perfect fitting Basic Block is ready you can start manipulating it like a pro, to have those gorgeous silk or woollen or lace dresses.</p><blockquote><p><em>As I said before,</em> <strong><em>the more patterns you make the less time you are going to spend</em></strong> <em>on the next designs.</em></p></blockquote><p>And that&rsquo;s because even pattern makers, well, especially, pattern makers do not draft from scratch or even Basic Block every season. Over time they create <strong><em>a library of pattern blocks</em></strong> - imagine them as puzzle pieces - that can be mixed together with minimal alterations for a variety of styles.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s call those pieces - <strong><em>Fashion Blocks</em></strong>.</p><h2 id=the-fashion-block>The Fashion Block</h2><blockquote><p><strong><em>Fashion</em></strong> <em>or</em> <strong><em>Intermediate Block</em></strong> <em>is a basic shape that is in use continually, it&rsquo;s a pattern piece that keeps popping up in many designs of a company or a wardrobe.</em></p></blockquote><p>For example, I love semi-fitted dresses with an A-line skirt, I&rsquo;ve recently realized that shirt dresses are what need in my closet &amp; I absolutely adore kimonos. So, my Fashion Blocks are a Semi-fitted Bodice, an A-line skirt, a shirt collar with a stand &amp;, of course, kimono which I use for silk T-Shirts, dresses &amp; dusters.</p><p>Every brand or every seamstress will have a unique collection of Fashion Blocks. I hope you also will have one soon, I can help you with it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all for today. Next week we&rsquo;ll be talking about &ldquo;Pattern Shapes &amp; Flat Patternmaking Methods &amp; Techniques&rdquo;.
