<span class=pull-right>05 February 20</span></p><p>After learning what <a href=/blog/01-block-patterns/>Block Patterns</a> are let’s take a closer look at a Basic Dress Block & what one needs to learn to transform it into other dresses.</p><h2 id=pattern-shapes>Pattern Shapes</h2><p>Here you can see a <em><strong>5-piece Basic Block</strong></em> for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front & Back Bodice pieces, Front & Back skirt pieces & a wrist-length set-in sleeve.</p><blockquote><p><em>From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations. Transformations, not all, but most of them, & what’s the most important, the principles of it can be applied to different Block Patterns: jackets, coats, blouses - whatever you like. The main goal is to understand the reasons & the process itself.</em></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/basic-dress.jpg alt="The Basic Dress Block" title="The Basic Dress Block"></p><p>The number of pattern pieces may vary depending on the patternmaking system: some offer whole front & whole back details, that you can cut later if needed, others have pre-divided bodice & skirt pieces. It doesn’t matter how many pieces you have, as long as you get your desired fit.</p><blockquote><p><em>But how does a 2-dimensional pattern transform into a 3-dimensional garment?</em></p></blockquote><p>Lately, we talked about <em><strong>a Basic Block Pattern</strong></em> following the contours of our body. In every pattern piece, there are the straight & curved outlines. The straight ones are shoulder, side & below-hip seams, the curved - waistline, armhole, hip, neckline, underarm sleeve seam may be both.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/pattern-shapes.jpg alt="Pattern Shapes" title="Pattern Shapes"></p><p>But even with this combination of straight & curved lines, the pattern will still be 2-dimensional while our bodies are not. Here come the <em><strong>darts</strong></em> - those triangular shapes.</p><h3 id=the-dart>The Dart</h3><p>Each piece of a Basic Block has darts & by transferring these darts around the pattern one can get various styles. But what is a dart?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Dart</strong></em> <em>is a folded wedge of fabric that confines unneeded fullness in certain areas to shape a garment to body curves.</em></p></blockquote><p>That amount of excess space is called <em><strong>dart intake</strong></em>. You can see it between the two <em><strong>dart legs</strong></em>. Dart legs are the two lines meeting at the <em><strong>dart point</strong></em>. Dart points are usually placed close to the apex of the bust, shoulder blade, buttock, abdomen & even elbow. A well-sewn & pressed dart gradually releases the intake & disappears at the apex point.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/dart.jpg alt="The front & back bodice pieces & dart parts" title="The Dart"></p><p>Depending on the body type & curves, the number of darts may vary a little: there may be two waist darts in the back & two in the front, someone may need one or two darts in the back & one in the front.</p><p>But darts are not only good for the fit, but they also offer a number of design possibilities: they can turn into fashion seams, tucks or gathers, of which I&rsquo;ll write in upcoming posts. But first, let’s see what techniques & methods will help us manipulate darts & make other alterations to the pattern.</p><h2 id=flat-patternmaking-methods>Flat Patternmaking Methods</h2><p>First of all, let’s clear what <em><strong>Flat Patternmaking</strong></em> is.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Flat Patternmaking</strong></em> <em>is a system of patternmaking, or pattern manipulation, in which previously created patterns - basic or fashion blocks - are modified to develop new various styles.</em></p></blockquote><p>It is a fast & efficient method, that helps in maintaining the consistency of size and fit of mass-produced garments.</p><p>To transform this block pattern into a final, or, in other words, design pattern one can use two patternmaking methods:</p><ul><li>Slash</li><li>Pivotal.</li></ul><p>You don’t need to choose only one method, both will appear through your patternmaking way.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Slash method</strong></em> <em>- according to the name, the pattern is slashed & spread or overlapped for</em> <em><strong>dart relocation, adding more fabric or creating a closer fit.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Before you start making any alterations to the block pattern, please, copy it. I’m not kidding. Never cut your block patterns & do store them safely. Take 5 - 10 minutes to trace them onto transparent paper, because drafting a new Basic Block every time you’d like to have a new design will take away much time.</p><p>Once <em><strong>the Block Pattern Copy</strong></em> has been slashed and taped, it should be traced onto a new sheet of paper to get <em><strong>the Design Pattern</strong></em>.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Pivotal method</strong></em> <em>- in this method pattern is not slashed but rotated around the Pivotal Point for dart relocation. It is a faster & more efficient way, though the method is based on the knowledge gained from slashing the pattern.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id=flat-patternmaking-techniques>Flat Patternmaking Techniques</h2><p>Above I mentioned 3 main patternmaking techniques:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dart manipulation</strong> is changing the location of a dart within the pattern frame.</p></blockquote><p>There are many rules & options for changing the dart location, of which we’ll talk later. At this moment, remember: if the dart remains directed to its pivotal point, you can shift, rotate, divide & combine it with other darts & still have the same fit as in the Basic Block dress. This way or the other darts will be a part of the design if you want to keep the same fit. You cannot just pretend the dart isn’t there.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Adding fullness</strong></em> <em>- if a dart excess is not enough, you can add extra fullness with the help of tucks, gathers, pleats, etc.</em></p></blockquote><p>In this case, the pattern becomes longer or wider, so extra fabric might be needed. Unlike a dart, added fullness is not directed to the pivotal point.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Contouring</strong></em> makes a pattern fit our curves even better than the Basic Block does. This happens with the help of new darts or the curved shape of the existing dart legs.</p></blockquote><p>New darts help avoid gapping ease at plunging necklines & armholes in sleeveless & strapless designs.
Curved darts give closer fit under bust. If we keep the dart legs straight in a front waist dart the fabric will go from bust pivotal point right to the waistline, but if we draw curves the pattern will replicate the shape of a bust. That could be a pretty elegant & feminine touch to a dress.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/techniques.jpg alt="3 patternmaking techniques" title="Patternmaking Techniques"></p><p>Yet these 3 fundamental techniques are not the only ones you should master with time: there also <em><strong>design elements</strong></em> like necklines, yokes, plackets, collars & pockets & <em><strong>support elements</strong></em> like facing. But don’t worry about them now.</p><h2 id=prepare-for-pattern-manipulation>Prepare for pattern manipulation</h2><p>Once you read all of the above, drafted your Basic Block & found an idea for a new design, take some time to think of the upcoming patternmaking process. Let’s divide it into 4 steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Analyze</strong> your new design.
Ask yourself: “What is the difference between my design & the Block I’m using?”. Maybe you have gathers instead of darts or you have a pleat at the back. If needed, write it all down.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify</strong> which patternmaking techniques you’ll need to apply. It may be tricky at the beginning, but we have 3 main techniques, so try to start with them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify</strong> which design & support elements your garment will have.
The spectrum of them is pretty wide, so there will be the things left in your list “what’s different between my design and the Block”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make</strong> the design pattern. This will take time. You can trace the existing Block & cut & tape the copy for slashing method or you can use the Block to draw the new pattern by the pivotal method. To finalize the pattern you’ll need to check it, add seam allowances & notches if some are missing.</p></li><li><p>Extra step: pour yourself a good cup of coffee or tea & take something sweet, you deserved it!</p></li></ol><p><img src=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/design-analysis.jpg alt="Design Analysis" title="Design Analysis"></p><h2 id=get-ready-for-following-posts>Get ready for following posts</h2><p>Before we part for another week, take a look at the list & a PDF attachment below. There you can find <em><strong>a 1:3 Scale 5-piece Basic Dress Block Pattern</strong></em>. We are going to need this during the following weeks for practice.</p><p>Here’s what you can do with with the file:</p><ol><li><p>You can download <a href=/img/posts/09-patternmaking-1-4/5-piece-basic-dress-block-template.pdf>the Basic Dress Block</a> and print on heavyweight or usual paper.</p></li><li><p>Cut out the Basic Block pieces out.</p></li><li><p>If your paper was thin, carefully glue pattern pieces to the cardboard of preferred weight. The better the cardboard the longer this set will last.</p></li><li><p>Let the sheets dry under a pile of books - this will prevent creases.</p></li><li><p>Cut the pieces out again.</p></li><li><p>With a thick sharp needle or an awl make neat holes at the dart & pivotal points.</p></li></ol><p>And finally, that’s all for today. Next time we are going to start manipulating darts. So, don’t forget your pencils, pens, rulers & paper: both usual & transparent.</p><p class=tags><span class=tag><a href=https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/tags/patternmaking/>#patternmaking</a></span>
