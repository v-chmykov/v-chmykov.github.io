Pattern Shapes Here you can see a 5-piece Basic Block for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front &amp;amp; Back Bodice pieces, Front &amp;amp; Back skirt pieces &amp;amp; a wrist-length set-in sleeve.
From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations.</description></item><item><title>Patternmaking Weekly.

Let&amp;rsquo;s find out what the first one is.
Block Patterns are the basic shapes which are later transformed into new garment designs.
You might find them not only in the apparel field but in bag, shoes &amp;amp; many other fields, which I know nothing about.</description></item><item><title>Patternmaking Weekly.

You might see the perfect one in a magazine, on a young &amp;amp; fresh girl who just walked out of a high-end fashion boutique or you might get lightened with inspiration in a fabric store when you see that silk organza with velvet dots.
Usually, when I get this sudden idea of a dress which &amp;ldquo;I-do-want-right-now-but-I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-why&amp;rdquo;, I wait for a couple of days - and that&amp;rsquo;s a really hard process - and if this dress still sits somewhere in the back of my head, that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to sew it.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat? Part 2.</title><link>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</guid><description>In the previous post I wrote about the difference between interfacing &amp;amp; interlining. There I described the fabrics &amp;amp; techniques I used to give this coat shape &amp;amp; support.
And now my hands are burning, because it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw a pattern for the inner structure.
The Interfacing Patterns I do not print the details of the inner structure in advance, so I place tracing paper on top of the pattern and draw new contours.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat?

Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. I need a sweater, and a hat and a scarf, and a sweater, yes, it will be warmer.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

If you’ve just joined, feel free to start with Part 1, which tells about inspiration &amp;amp; preparatory process, &amp;amp; Part 2 – there you can read about patterns &amp;amp; samples.
Let’s continue!
7. Cutting the fashion fabric Well-done cutting also needs some rules:
The fabric needs pre-shrinking with heat or water beforehand, so that after the first wash the M-size blouse won’t unexpectedly turn into XXS.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

It tells about inspiration, ideas, ways of getting a pattern &amp;amp; measurements. If you please, I’ll continue.
4. Pattern The construction of the pattern in the drafting method is divided into 3 stages:
Drafting of the Basic Block The Flat Patternmaking, or pattern manipulation. It is the process of transformation of a Basic Block into the desired pattern The Design Pattern - the final pattern with markings &amp;amp; seam allowances Spatial thinking, mathematics, drawing skills and creative sense are useful here, even if they are yet sleeping, patience, perseverance and attentiveness will help to cope with the task.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

Unexpectedly, the choice that the magazines provided was not enough, and the decision to create a dress from the beginning to the end came by itself. This was the beginning of a new era.
At that moment, I was left alone with my knowledge, skills and a million doubts. There was nothing that could help, no trued pattern, no step-by-step instructions, or even a brief scheme.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

The first part of this story tells about the idea, that evolved into this beautiful skirt, its patternmaking process &amp;amp; cutting. So, if you missed it, please, click a link above.
Be my guest and enjoy.
Attaching the Interlining For interlining I choose the cambric, which, for some unknown reason, already lied in the closet.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

“Stripes are always in fashion, but now especially aggressive ones.” Horizontal and vertical at the same time, wide and narrow in super-bright colours. “
Wrote the Vogue magazine on top of the vivid photos from the shows of Fendi, Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler in an article about the fashion trends of the upcoming 2017 year.
Snow is already falling in the morning, the sun gently shines through the window &amp;amp; it’s cold.</description></item></channel></rss>
