As soon as snow covers the streets, I start to feel an uncontrollable desire to warm myself with at least one new sweater. Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. I need a sweater, and a hat and a scarf, and a sweater, yes, it will be warmer.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

If you’ve just joined, feel free to start with [Part 1](), which tells about inspiration &amp;amp; preparatory process, &amp;amp; [Part 2]() – there you can read about patterns &amp;amp; samples. Let’s continue!
7. Cutting the fashion fabric Well-done cutting also needs some rules:
The fabric needs pre-shrinking with heat or water beforehand, so that after the first wash the M-size blouse won’t unexpectedly turn into XXS.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

It tells about inspiration, ideas, ways of getting a pattern &amp;amp; measurements. If you please, I’ll continue.
4. Pattern The construction of the pattern in the drafting method is divided into 3 stages:
Drafting of the Basic Block The Flat Patternmaking, or pattern manipulation. It is the process of transformation of a Basic Block into the desired pattern The Design Pattern - the final pattern with markings &amp;amp; seam allowances Spatial thinking, mathematics, drawing skills and creative sense are useful here, even if they are yet sleeping, patience, perseverance and attentiveness will help to cope with the task.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

So, Who are you? I am Kaya Meier, Illustrator and pattern maker of women�s clothing. In my spare time I write articles about sewing and clothing design and publish them in this blog. And at work I help clients to walk the way from the first sketch to the final pattern. To do this I discuss ideas with them, draw fashion sketches, technical drawings in real proportions and make patterns for online pattern shops and family scale manufacturers .</description></item><item><title>Name of the work 6</title><link>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/work6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 19:56:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/work6/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Fifth abundantly made Give sixth hath.
