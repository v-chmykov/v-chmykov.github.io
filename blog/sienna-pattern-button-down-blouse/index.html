Thank you for taking the time to stop by.</em></p></blockquote><p><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-blouse-cover.jpg alt="Sienna Blouse Cover" title="Sienna Blouse Cover"></p><blockquote><p><em>For all my fellow sewing enthusiasts eager to dive into their next project, here’s the link to purchase the Sienna pattern in my <a href=https://dressedinadressstore.etsy.com>Etsy Store</a>. And while you’re here, take a moment to explore the post itself—it is crafted with care and filled with insights and inspiration. Happy sewing.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-prologue>THE PROLOGUE</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Today blouses are not worn quite as much as they used to be and I think it is a pity.
Of course, many suits can be worn without a blouse, but I think it is very nice when it is warm enough for you to take off your jacket and show a pretty blouse. [&mldr;]”</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Christian Dior, “The Little Dictionary of Fashion”, 1954, B, Blouses</em></p><p>For centuries, shirts and blouses have been essential wardrobe staples. They have undergone significant style changes, from the collarless garments of the 14th century to the iconic white shirts of the 1950s and the colourful and textured shirts of recent decades. By this point, they have evolved from essential undergarments to items that convey status or symbolise rebellion.</p><h3 id=the-motivation>The Motivation</h3><p>Believing every day is for celebration, I used to choose flashy and complex garments in the past, and I often struggled to embrace minimalist designs. So, it was no surprise that one day, I realised the importance of having essential items in my wardrobe, as my existing pieces didn’t mix well. The new pieces would not replace but instead, be an addition to the more complex ones I already had. And I was committed to creating most of them myself.</p><p>One of the things I wanted to design was a shirt. However, traditional stiff shirts with starched collars didn’t resonate with me, as I only began exploring the “clean” aesthetic. After numerous hours of inspiration-seeking online, I decided to create a shirt or blouse that could effortlessly mix minimalism and relaxed elegance, which my wardrobe lacked, and a dash of drama: a garment that seamlessly blends classic shirt elements with a modern twist.</p><p>I wanted it to be versatile enough to wear with different outfits, buttoned-up and unbuttoned with a top under it, tucked in and not, and serve as a solid foundation for my wardrobe. However, I was still searching for something special to make my design stand out.</p><details><summary><i class="fa fa-chevron-right details-opened" aria-hidden=true></i><i class="fa fa-chevron-down details-closed" aria-hidden=true></i>On Shirts & Blouses</summary><p>While searching for design ideas on Pinterest and feeling uninspired by never-ending cotton shirts, I slowly began to gravitate towards a more flexible and less restrictive option—a minimalist blouse. However, I realised I didn’t know precisely the difference between a shirt and a blouse.</p><p>Curious, I arranged a small Q&A among friends who wear both and found out that, for them, shirts were an irreplaceable item of menswear. At the same time, blouses were a part of women’s fashion. At first, I was puzzled by the finding, but after flipping through several books, I came to the conclusion that, for me, shirts usually have a more structured, polished look with classic collars, cuffs, and front buttons. Blouses, on the other hand, feel lighter and often have unique touches like bow collars, ruffles, and gathers.</p><p>But as I browsed through a few online stores, I noticed something interesting—whether an item is called a blouse or a shirt often depends on the fabric and styling, blurring the lines between the two. For example, a light blouse with a pointed collar and square cuffs could easily pass as a shirt, while a shirt with dramatic ruffles might look more like a blouse.</p></details><h2 id=the-design>THE DESIGN</h2><p>As I, quite bored and frustrated at the time, continued doom-scrolling through countless pages, I stumbled upon an image that finally and unexpectedly caught my eye—a blouse with intricately shaped cuffs. That was the inspiration I had been waiting for. I knew I wanted to make a relaxed blouse with classic shirt elements, but I still needed a unique twist to make a statement. I wanted to have a balance between almost opposite sides of me.</p><p>And so the idea for the Sienna blouse was born.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-blouse-main-shot.jpg alt="Sienna Blouse (view A)" title="Sienna Blouse (view A)"></p><p>Its relaxed silhouette with unusual cascading double-layered cuffs draws attention and sets Sienna apart from the ordinary. The poet cuffs have a handkerchief shape with draped inverted pleats, adding a charming touch to the ensemble, not too loud, not too subtle. A narrow banded cuff is hidden underneath. A snap, accent button, and button loop keep it in place.</p><p>If the poet cuffs don’t suit your taste, you can choose between romantic narrow or classic two-button square cuffs.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-blouse-cuffs.jpg alt="Sienna Blouse: Poet Cuffs (view A)" title="Sienna Blouse: Poet Cuffs (view A)"></p><p>As for the rest of the blouse, it’s a classic with a chic, effortless touch. To ensure comfort and elegance, I opted for a dartless bodice with dropped shoulders, a box pleat at the back, and a stylish shirttail hem that falls slightly below the crotch. I always struggled to find matching buttons, so I transformed the traditional single-fold placket into a concealed one, hiding the shirt buttons in this design. However, I couldn’t resist adding fabric-covered buttons to the collar stand and cuffs for a subtle accent.</p><div class="owl-carousel owl-theme"><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-blouse-front.jpg alt="Sienna Blouse (view A): Front" title="Sienna Blouse (view A): Front">

<img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-blouse-cuffs-side.jpg alt="Sienna Blouse (view A): Cuffs" title="Sienna Blouse (view A): Cuffs"></div><p>Buttons and plackets are not the only elements that make Sienna unique yet versatile. The loose-fitting collar stand and collar with a delicate roll line allow for comfortable movement and breathing. The one-piece set-in sleeves with pleated hemline provide a relaxed silhouette and ample room at the biceps and elbows for both style and comfort.</p><p>The relaxed fit of the Sienna blouse is perfect for layering over a sleeveless top, giving you so many styling options while keeping things refined, even when worn unbuttoned. And with three cuff styles and endless fabric possibilities, you have so many ways to make the Sienna truly your own.</p><p>Who says building an essential wardrobe has to be boring?</p><p>Now, let’s see what’s in Sienna’s actual pattern package.</p><h2 id=the-pattern>THE PATTERN</h2><h3 id=quick-summary>Quick Summary</h3><ul><li><strong>The Style:</strong>  Sienna is a relaxed-fit blouse with a pointed collar, slightly dropped shoulders, a curved hem, and long sleeves. It has a concealed front placket for added elegance, its length falls just below the crotch, and the blouse can be worn tucked in or not. The blouse comes with three cuff options (also known as “views”): a square buttoned cuff (<em>view C</em>) is the ultimate classic, a narrow banded cuff (<em>view B</em>) adds a romantic touch, and the draped poet cuffs (<em>view A</em>) make a chic statement.</li></ul><div class="owl-carousel owl-theme"><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-style-guide-p1.jpg alt="Sienna Syle Guide: Part 1" title="Sienna Style Guide: Part 1">

<img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-style-guide-p3.jpg alt="Sienna Syle Guide: Part 3" title="Sienna Style Guide: Part 3"></div><ul><li><strong>The Fabric:</strong> Sienna’s final appearance depends on the fabric chosen. Recommended fabrics include non-stretch light- to medium-weight woven shirt and blouse fabrics. Viscose, silk crepe, twill, or satin are good options for softer blouses with drape, necessary for the cuff flounces. Crisp fabrics like cotton poplin and chambray create a classic shirt style when combined with square cuffs. Natural fibre fabrics offer maximum breathability.</li><li><strong>The Sewing Process:</strong> This pattern is designed for an intermediate skill level. The best way to sew this blouse is on a conventional sewing machine. When creating garments, I always strive for a flawless, high-quality finish. That’s why this blouse has french and bias bound seams that give a luxurious, clean finish. For a quicker alternative, you can use a 3-thread overlock stitch with an overlock machine.</li></ul><h3 id=the-size-range>The Size Range</h3><p>The pattern is available in EU sizes 32–42. When you buy the pattern, you can choose one of three size ranges: 32–36, 36–40, and 38–42. Each range contains three sizes, sufficient for between-sizes pattern adjustments.</p><p>Before selecting your size range, review the Size charts. You can find them below and, of course, on Sienna’s Etsy page, in both metric and imperial units.</p><p>To choose the correct size:</p><ol><li>Follow the <a href=/pdf/taking-measurements-by-dressed-in-a-dress-2024.pdf><em>“Taking Measurements”</em></a> guide for accurate body measurements.</li><li>Match your measurements to the size chart, focusing on the closest column.</li></ol><blockquote><p><em>Always choose your blouse size based on your bust measurement for the best fit.</em></p></blockquote><p>You can also refer to the <em>“Finished Garment Charts”</em> for information on the garment’s ease. Simply subtract the size-chart body measurement from the corresponding garment’s measurement to determine the intended fit. If the fit feels too tight, consider going up a size.</p><p>If your measurements don’t match the sizing chart, you can always adjust the pattern. For example, you can blend sizes, add wider seam allowances, or lengthen/shorten the pattern. No need to worry if you’re new to this; a tutorial on <a href=/blog/basic-pattern-adjustments/>Basic Sewing Pattern Adjustments</a> is available just for you. If you prefer .pdf files to online pages, a detailed guide to these adjustments comes with the Sienna booklet.</p><div class="owl-carousel owl-theme"><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/dressed-in-a-dress-size-chart-metric-long.jpg alt="Dressed in a Dress Size Chart—Metric" title="Dressed in a Dress Size Chart—Metric">

The only thing I never questioned was that I wanted to create a high-quality product. As the only person working on the project, juggling designing, writing, photo-editing and many other tasks, I can’t offer additional support. Still, I did not want to leave you with a million questions, so I prepared detailed instructions and illustrations covering various topics, from fabric preparation to the final stitch. And after countless versions and revisions, I finally combined the Sienna pattern package.</p><p>If you’ve already discovered my Jane tee pattern, which I’ve been releasing for free for some time now, you’ve seen a glimpse of what’s to expect with the Dressed in a Dress patterns. But Sienna is so much more. For example, it has a three-times longer booklet and fully illustrated instructions.</p><p>To give you a better idea of what’s unique about the Sienna pattern package, let’s take a closer look at it. When you buy a Dressed in a Dress pattern, you will receive a digital pattern package including the following files:</p><ul><li>An illustrated step-by-step <strong>sewing instruction in PDF</strong> format with additional attachments on taking measurements, reading, and adjusting the pattern.<ul><li>The 82-page illustrated booklet includes special sections on style details, supplies and skills to give you an overview of the sewing process ahead.</li><li>It also has a size guide, yardage, and finished garment measurement charts that help you choose the correct size.</li><li>A pattern overview, fabric preparation notes and cutting layouts in two fabric widths explain how to prepare and cut your fabric.</li><li>You’ll also find over 30 pages of illustrated sewing instructions guiding you from the first stitch to the last.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="owl-carousel owl-theme"><img src=/img/posts/21-sienna-blouse-pattern/sienna-pages-cover-overview.jpg alt="Sienna Pattern: Cover & Pattern Overview Pages" title="Sienna Pattern: Cover & Pattern Overview Pages">
