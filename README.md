## Dressed-in-a-Dress - sewing blog

### So, what are you?
I am Kaya Meier,
an I am an illustrator for sewing processes, technical drawings & fashion in
the field of womenswear. Most of the time I work with dresses, blouses & skirts.

### What can you help me with?
If you already have a sewing-pattern brand or starting one, I can help with the graphical part. This means I can illustrate sewing instructions, draw fashion flats & style cutting layouts. Also, I can put all those pretty pictures in place, because I have skills in creating page layouts in InDesign.

### Aha, clear. What is special about your work?
Though I’m self-taught, for 2.5 years I worked as a tutor for sewing & patternmaking. So, I know pattern marking & various sewing techniques. For the first part of my sewing life, my mom & I used commercial sewing-patterns, so I’m no stranger to them. Also, I have an architectural education. It gave me a strong basis for graphics, both hand & digital, logic, technical processes, time management & spatial thinking.
So, I can work with text descriptions, rough sketches & photos as references, though it always depends on pattern complexity.
I enjoy constant projects & small teams. 
I live in Berlin & work remotely, so my clients come from different countries.

### How can I reach you?
