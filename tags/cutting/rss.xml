Techniques for Sewing</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/lace-and-embroidered-fabric-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/lace-and-embroidered-fabric-part-2/</guid><description>There are no certain rules for every exact lace because everything depends on the tread type, the background and overall quality, but there are some common guides for all laces.
