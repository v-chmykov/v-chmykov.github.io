Pattern Shapes Here you can see a 5-piece Basic Block for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front &amp;amp; Back Bodice pieces, Front &amp;amp; Back skirt pieces &amp;amp; a wrist-length set-in sleeve.
From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations.</description></item><item><title>01.

Let&amp;rsquo;s find out what the first one is.
Block Patterns are the basic shapes which are later transformed into new garment designs.
You might find them not only in the apparel field but in bag, shoes &amp;amp; many other fields, which I know nothing about.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/introduction/</guid><description>Every dress starts with an idea. You might see the perfect one in a magazine, on a young &amp;amp; fresh girl who just walked out of a high-end fashion boutique or you might get lightened with inspiration in a fabric store when you see that silk organza with velvet dots.
Usually, when I get this sudden idea of a dress which &amp;ldquo;I-do-want-right-now-but-I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-why&amp;rdquo;, I wait for a couple of days - and that&amp;rsquo;s a really hard process - and if this dress still sits somewhere in the back of my head, that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to sew it.</description></item></channel></rss>
