I hear this question for the hundredth time. So I breathe out quietly in a meditative manner and with a mysterious smile, I answer that I’m sewing neither one nor the other.
After all, I know that in a dozen stitches I will finish the bohemian kimono, which I have wanted for many years.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat? Part 2.</title><link>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://v-chmykov.github.io/blog/inside-the-fur-coat-part-2/</guid><description>In the previous post I wrote about the difference between interfacing &amp;amp; interlining. There I described the fabrics &amp;amp; techniques I used to give this coat shape &amp;amp; support.
And now my hands are burning, because it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw a pattern for the inner structure.
The Interfacing Patterns I do not print the details of the inner structure in advance, so I place tracing paper on top of the pattern and draw new contours.</description></item><item><title>What’s inside the fur coat?

Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. I need a sweater, and a hat and a scarf, and a sweater, yes, it will be warmer.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

4. Pattern A pattern is the template, the blueprint, from which the parts of a garment - like sleeves, front &amp;amp; back bodice, collar, etc. - are placed &amp;amp; traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. Patterns may be drafted manually or digitally.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

Unexpectedly, the choice that the magazines provided was not enough, and the decision to create a dress from the beginning to the end came by itself. This was the beginning of a new era.
At that moment, I was left alone with my knowledge, skills and a million doubts. There was nothing that could help, no trued pattern, no step-by-step instructions, or even a brief scheme.</description></item><item><title>Ruffles ‘n Stripes: One Skirt Story.

“Stripes are always in fashion, but now especially aggressive ones.” Horizontal and vertical at the same time, wide and narrow in super-bright colours.“
