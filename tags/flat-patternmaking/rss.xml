If we think of a basic block dress, the back bodice may seem less inspiring than the front one, but the fact that we don’t see our backs every time we look in the mirror doesn’t mean that this back should be overlooked.
Regarding dart manipulations in the back, there might be fewer options than in the front piece, but there are still various design possibilities that will ensure a proper fit.</description></item><item><title>05. Common Dart Manipulations: Single-Dart Designs</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/05-common-dart-manipulations-single-dart-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/05-common-dart-manipulations-single-dart-design/</guid><description>Darts play a crucial role in our garments, providing structural integrity and aesthetic appeal, particularly in fitted and semi-fitted designs. Earlier in this Patternmaking Series, we talked about the core elements of the front bodice: the bust and waist darts. We discussed how and why their location could change and learned about the Slash and Pivotal methods that help achieve various two-dart designs.
To refresh the memories, take a look at the previous posts that tell about dart manipulation in the two-dart designs:</description></item><item><title>04. Common Dart Manipulations: Two-Dart Designs. Pivotal Method</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/04-common-dart-manipulations-two-dart-design-pivotal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/04-common-dart-manipulations-two-dart-design-pivotal/</guid><description>Continuing with the patternmaking series, we are ready to delve deeper into dart manipulations using the pivotal method. Building on the concepts explored in the previous post with the slash method, we will now learn about the creative potential of another technique. If you’re new to the series or missed the previous post, I recommend starting there to grasp the foundation for today’s tutorial.
Today, we’ll continue working with the same two-dart designs as before, but this time, we’ll employ the pivotal method to create our patterns.</description></item><item><title>03.

I hope you have already printed and prepared the 1:3 scale basic block, which I shared in the previous post. If you have just joined us or had no time to make it before, don’t worry; click the link and follow the directions at the bottom of the page.
In this post, we will need only the basic front bodice piece.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</guid><description>Every dress starts with an idea. You might see the perfect one in a magazine, on a young and fresh girl who just walked out of a high-end fashion boutique or you might get lightened with inspiration in a fabric store when you see that silk organza with velvet dots.
Usually, when I get this sudden idea of a dress which &amp;ldquo;I-do-want-right-now-but-I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-why&amp;rdquo;,I wait for a couple of days—and that’s a challenging process—and if this dress still sits somewhere in the back of my head, that’s it, I’m going to sew it.</description></item></channel></rss>
