There I described the fabrics &amp;amp; techniques I used to give this coat shape &amp;amp; support.
And now my hands are burning, because it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw a pattern for the inner structure.

Every time I finish a new knitted something, I swear to never touch the needles again. And every time, as soon as it becomes cold &amp;amp; dark, I start ordering yarn.

“Stripes are always in fashion, but now especially aggressive ones. Horizontal &amp;amp; vertical at the same time, wide &amp;amp; narrow in super-bright colours.“
Wrote the Vogue magazine on top of the vivid photos from the shows of Fendi, Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler in an article about the fashion trends of the upcoming 2017 year.
