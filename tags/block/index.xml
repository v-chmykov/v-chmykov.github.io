Pattern Shapes Here you can see a 5-piece Basic Block for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front &amp;amp; Back Bodice pieces, Front &amp;amp; Back skirt pieces &amp;amp; a wrist-length set-in sleeve.
From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations.</description></item><item><title>01.

You might find them not only in the apparel field but in bag, shoes &amp;amp; many other fields, which I know nothing about.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/introduction/</guid><description>Every dress starts with an idea. You might see the perfect one in a magazine, on a young &amp;amp; fresh girl who just walked out of a high-end fashion boutique or you might get lightened with inspiration in a fabric store when you see that silk organza with velvet dots.
Usually, when I get this sudden idea of a dress which &amp;ldquo;I-do-want-right-now-but-I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-why&amp;rdquo;, I wait for a couple of days - and that&amp;rsquo;s a really hard process - and if this dress still sits somewhere in the back of my head, that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to sew it.</description></item><item><title>What Does It Take to Create a Garment?

4. Pattern A pattern is the template, the blueprint, from which the parts of a garment - like sleeves, front &amp;amp; back bodice, collar, etc. - are placed &amp;amp; traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. Patterns may be drafted manually or digitally.</description></item></channel></rss>
