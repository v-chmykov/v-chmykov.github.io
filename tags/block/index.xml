Pattern Shapes Here you can see a 5-piece Basic Block for a semi-fitted dress made of non-stretchy woven fabric. There are Front &amp;amp; Back Bodice pieces, Front &amp;amp; Back skirt pieces &amp;amp; a wrist-length set-in sleeve.
From now on I’ll be using this set to show different pattern manipulations.</description></item><item><title>01.

4. Pattern A pattern is the template, the blueprint, from which the parts of a garment - like sleeves, front &amp;amp; back bodice, collar, etc. - are placed &amp;amp; traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled.
