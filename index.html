And every time, as soon as it becomes cold and dark, I start ordering yarn. This year, the yarn did not help. A spontaneous trip to a fabric store for just to have a look ended up with me happily wrapped in a new shaggy piece of eco fur. After a month and a half, it will turn into a fur coat, which will make passers-by turn around.</p></div><hr><div class="box-masonry-category text-justify"><p class="post-list-category text-center"><a href=/category/sewing-story>Sewing Story</a></p></div></div></div></article><article class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-4 masonry-item"><div class=box-masonry><a href=https://dressed-in-a-dress.com/blog/create-a-garment-part-3/ title="What Does It Take to Create a Garment?
