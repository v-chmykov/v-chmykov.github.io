Whether you’re curious about sizing, tiled layouts, or pattern attachments, you’ll find all the answers below.</p><h2 id=product-information>Product Information</h2><h5 id=what-do-i-receive-with-my-pattern-package>What do I receive with my pattern package?</h5><p>When you buy a Dressed in a Dress pattern, you will receive a digital pattern package including the following files:</p><ul><li>An illustrated step-by-step sewing instruction in PDF format with additional attachments on taking measurements, reading, and adjusting the pattern.</li><li>A .zip folder containing a series of pattern PDF files in your chosen size range (32–36, 36–40 or 38–42), a list of pattern files (.txt), and a test square (.pdf).</li><li>A brief instruction (.txt) on accessing the files.</li></ul><p>If you’re using my free pattern, the booklet includes simplified sewing instructions without illustrations, and the pattern files are attached directly to the booklet—no need for a separate zip folder.</p><hr><h5 id=are-your-patterns-available-in-languages-other-than-english>Are your patterns available in languages other than English?</h5><p>Currently, Dressed in a Dress patterns and booklets are only available in English. There are no plans for translations at the moment.</p><hr><h5 id=what-skill-level-do-i-need-for-dressed-in-a-dress-patterns>What skill level do I need for Dressed in a Dress patterns?</h5><p>The current pattern collection consists of one intermediate-level pattern, <a href=/blog/sienna-pattern-button-down-blouse/>Sienna: Button-Down Blouse</a> available on Etsy and one skilled-beginner pattern, <a href=/blog/jane-pattern-boxy-t-shirt/>Jane Boxy Crewneck T-Shirt</a> which you can find here, in my Sewing Journal. As the collection grows, patterns will cover a variety of skill levels. Each pattern will include a suggested skill level in its description.</p><hr><h5 id=do-the-patterns-include-seam-allowances>Do the patterns include seam allowances?</h5><p>Yes! Dressed in a Dress patterns come with built-in seam allowances specifically designed for finishes and techniques used in the pattern. Both the instructions and the pattern piece labels specify the seam allowance measurements. Be sure to follow these as you cut and sew.</p><p>If you’d like to use seam allowances of other widths, you can turn off the existing ones with the layers function using the most current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer.</p><hr><h5 id=can-i-use-fabrics-and-finishes-different-from-those-recommended-in-the-instruction-booklet>Can I use fabrics and finishes different from those recommended in the instruction booklet?</h5><p>Absolutely! You’re the designer of your garment, so feel free to experiment with different fabrics and finishes for your garment. Just ensure they match the recommended materials’ weight, properties, and purpose. If you’re trying something new, consider making a test garment with inexpensive fabric that has similar properties to the one you’ve chosen. This way, you can see how everything works, test new techniques, and make any adjustments.</p><hr><h2 id=sizing>Sizing</h2><h5 id=what-sizes-are-available-for-the-patterns>What sizes are available for the patterns?</h5><p>The patterns come in EU sizes 32–42, split into three ranges: 32–36, 36–40, and 38–42. When buying a paid pattern, remember that each Etsy listing offers one range. As for the free pattern, according to its release conditions, one person can request only one size range.</p><p>Each range contains three sizes, sufficient for in-between-sizes pattern adjustments. To choose the correct size, refer to the <em>Size and Finished Garment Measurements</em> charts in the listing or the pattern overview post.</p><hr><h5 id=how-do-i-choose-the-correct-size>How do I choose the correct size?</h5><p>To determine the correct size for your Dressed in a Dress pattern:</p><ol><li>Refer to the size chart in the Etsy listing, pattern overview post or the pattern booklet and take your body measurements as instructed in the <em>“Taking measurements”</em> guide, which you can find <a href=/pdf/taking-measurements-by-dressed-in-a-dress-2024.pdf>here</a>. It is also attached to the booklet PDF file if you need later.</li><li>Compare your measurements to the size chart and choose the size that best matches your measurements.</li></ol><blockquote><p><em>Select the top size based on your bust measurement and the bottom size based on your hip measurement.</em></p></blockquote><hr><h5 id=can-i-adjust-the-pattern-to-fit-my-measurements>Can I adjust the pattern to fit my measurements?</h5><p>Yes, my paid patterns include a detailed guide for making common adjustments, such as blending sizes, drafting in-between sizes, creating extra-wide seam allowances, and lengthening or shortening the pattern. For the free pattern, I’ve written a separate <a href=/blog/basic-pattern-adjustments/>blog post</a> that covers similar adjustments to help you tailor the pattern to your measurements.</p><p>If you need more advanced alterations, I recommend exploring additional pattern adjustment resources or seeking professional advice.</p><hr><h2 id=accessing-and-viewing-the-files>Accessing and Viewing the Files</h2><h5 id=what-software-do-i-need-to-open-view-and-print-the-booklet-and-the-pattern>What software do I need to open, view and print the booklet and the pattern?</h5><p>For both the paid and free patterns, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader* to open, view, and print the booklet and pattern files. It is free software that allows you to view and print PDF files. It is widely used and available on various platforms, including Windows, Mac, and mobile devices.</p><p>You can download Acrobat Reader from the official <a href=https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-reader.html>Adobe website</a> or your device’s app store. Once installed, you can open the PDF files containing the booklet and pattern using Acrobat Reader and access all the features, including printing specific pages or sections of the document.</p><blockquote><p>*<em>Please note that other PDF readers may not support all the features and layers of the pattern files.</em></p></blockquote><p>The paid patterns come with an independent .zip folder containing the pattern files. You don’t need to install special software to open this folder, as most operating systems have built-in tools for unzipping files. Double-click the folder, just like any other folder on your computer. If that doesn’t work, the pattern package has brief instructions, in .txt format, on accessing the files in the .zip folder.</p><p>The free pattern booklet contains the pattern files attached directly to it, so no unzipping is necessary.</p><hr><h5 id=can-i-access-the-booklet-and-pattern-files-on-my-mobile-device>Can I access the booklet and pattern files on my mobile device?</h5><p>Yes, you can access the booklet and pattern files using the Adobe Acrobat Reader mobile app, available for both iOS and Android.</p><blockquote><p><em>However, be aware that mobile apps for PDFs don’t support the layers panel yet. While you can view the instructions and attachments, the layers function won’t be available on mobile devices.</em></p></blockquote><hr><h5 id=what-are-pdf-attachments-how-do-i-access-them>What are PDF attachments? How do I access them?</h5><p>PDF attachments are additional files included within the main PDF booklet. They can be pattern files or extra instructions and guides that accompany the pattern.</p><p>To access attachments in the booklet PDF, you need to use the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.​ Once you have opened the document, go to <em>View > Show > Navigation > Attachments</em>, and you’ll see a list of attachments in the document.</p><hr><h5 id=how-large-are-the-files-and-will-they-take-a-long-time-to-download>How large are the files, and will they take a long time to download?</h5><p>For paid patterns on Etsy, all files are under the marketplace’s 20 MB limit, so they should download quickly. The free pattern is even smaller in size, as it contains less content. However, download times may vary based on your internet speed. If you notice delays, try switching to a more stable or faster connection.</p><hr><h2 id=tiled-layout--layers-function>Tiled Layout & Layers Function</h2><h5 id=what-is-a-tiled-pattern-layout>What is a tiled pattern layout?</h5><p>A tiled pattern layout refers to a method of presenting a sewing pattern in a format that you can print on standard home printers. The pattern is divided into multiple pages in a grid-like arrangement, with each page containing a portion of the pattern. Once done with printing, you can trim and tape these pages together to create a full-size pattern. Each tile contains special triangular notches that indicate which tile you should tape where.</p><hr><h5 id=what-is-a-layer-function-in-the-pattern-files-how-do-i-access-it>What is a layer function in the pattern files? How do I access it?</h5><p>The layer function in pattern files allows you to selectively display or hide specific sizes or pattern elements within the digital pattern file. Thus, you can customize the pattern file’s display to suit your needs, making it easier to work with and reducing visual clutter.</p><p>To access and turn off layers, open the pattern file on your computer * using the most current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. Then, go to the drop-down menu <em>View > Show > Navigation > Layers</em>. Alternatively, you can press the F4 key, and the icons for <em>Page, Thumbnails, Attachments, and Layers</em> will appear on the side. Then, click the eye icon next to the sizes you don’t need to make them disappear.</p><blockquote><p>*<em>Unfortunately, as of the time this FAQ page is published, mobile apps for viewing and editing PDF files do not support the layers panel. You can view the instructions and attachments on your mobile device, but the layers function will be unavailable.</em></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=printing--assembling-the-pattern>Printing & Assembling the Pattern</h2><h5 id=can-i-print-dressed-in-a-dress-patterns-at-home>Can I print Dressed in a Dress patterns at home?</h5><p>Yes, Dressed in a Dress patterns are formatted for home printing on standard A4 or US Letter-size paper. Make sure to follow the printing instructions provided in the booklet to ensure accurate scaling and alignment.</p><hr><h5 id=how-do-i-print-the-pattern-files>How do I print the pattern files?</h5><p>Before printing the entire pattern, always print the test square, which you can find as a separate file. This square will help you check that you print the files correctly. Open the file in Adobe Acrobat Reader, go to the print settings, select the appropriate paper size (A4 or US Letter) and choose the des red printing options (colour or grayscale). Choose 100% scale or the actual size, print, take a ruler and make sure the test square is precisely 10 × 10 cm (4″ × 4″).</p><p>Once the test square checks out, apply the same settings to print the whole pattern and follow the instructions in the booklet for turning off sizes you don’t need and adjusting the layers.</p><hr><h5 id=why-is-my-pattern-not-printing-correctly>Why is my pattern not printing correctly?</h5><p>If your pattern is not printing correctly, please double-check that you have selected the correct print settings. Check that the paper size is set to A4 or US Letter, depending on your region. Additionally, ensure the scaling option is set to “Actual Size” or “100%”. If the issue persists, try printing a test page or consult your printer’s user manual for further troubleshooting steps.</p><hr><h5 id=how-do-i-assemble-the-printed-pattern>How do I assemble the printed pattern?</h5><p>To assemble the printed pattern, refer to the <em>“Printing the Pattern”</em> and the <em>“Pattern Assembly”</em> sections in the instructions booklet. They will provide a layout diagram and instructions on how to match the tiles and tape them together. Pay attention to the triangular notches and corresponding tiles indicated in the document.</p><hr><h2 id=download-and-file-issues>Download and File Issues</h2><h5 id=what-should-i-do-if-i-cant-download-my-pattern-etsy-only>What should I do if I can’t download my pattern? (Etsy Only)</h5><p>If you’re having trouble downloading your pattern, it might be due to an issue with your web browser. Try switching off add-ons like ad blockers or toolbars, and give it another go. If your computer says the file is corrupted, delete it and download it again from your Etsy account, making sure your internet connection is stable.</p><p>Also, please note that Etsy currently doesn’t allow file downloads through the mobile app. To download your files on a phone or tablet, you’ll need to open a web browser and log into your Etsy account from there. You’ll find the files under <em>Your Account > Purchases</em>.</p><p>If you’re still having issues, it could be a software problem. Ensure you use the right program, like Adobe Acrobat Reader, to open the file. If nothing works, Etsy Support might be able to step in and help.</p><hr><h5 id=what-if-the-files-wont-open-or-appear-corrupted>What if the files won’t open or appear corrupted?</h5><p>If the files won’t open or seem corrupted, re-download them from your Etsy account (paid patterns) or email (free pattern). Make sure your internet connection is stable during the download. Use Adobe Acrobat Reader to open the files, as other PDF readers may not support all features. If problems persist, you might also want to check your computer’s storage space or try downloading the files on a different device.</p><hr><h2 id=usage-rights>Usage Rights</h2><h5 id=can-i-sell-garments-made-from-your-patterns>Can I sell garments made from your patterns?</h5><p>No, Dressed in a Dress patterns are for personal use only. You can’t use them for small-scale or mass production of garments, nor sell the patterns in any form—whether in whole or in part, in digital or printed format. Selling garments made from these patterns is subject to copyright restrictions.</p><hr><h5 id=can-i-share-the-pattern-or-instruction-booklet-with-others>Can I share the pattern or instruction booklet with others?</h5><p>No, the pattern package, including the pattern, booklet, and attachments, is for personal use only. ​ It cannot be reproduced or transmitted in any form, including sharing with others. Sharing the pattern files with others without proper authorization will infringe on copyright laws.</p><hr><h5 id=why-are-the-booklet-and-pattern-files-protected-by-a-password>Why are the booklet and pattern files protected by a password?</h5><p>The booklet and pattern files are password-protected to maintain the integrity of the design and prevent unauthorized alterations. You won’t need the password for regular use, like viewing or printing the files. However, the protection helps ensure the pattern remains unmodified, preserving the quality of your sewing experience. Any attempt to bypass this protection would violate the terms of use.</p><hr><h5 id=can-i-share-my-finished-garments-made-from-dressed-in-a-dress-patterns-on-social-media>Can I share my finished garments made from Dressed in a Dress patterns on social media?</h5><p>Of course, just tag my Instagram account, @_kaia_meier, and use hashtags mentioned in the <em>“P.S.”</em> section of the booklet. Sharing your creations on social media is a great way to connect with other sewing enthusiasts and showcase your creations.</p><hr><h2 id=customer-support-refunds-and-returns-etsy-only>Customer Support, Refunds, and Returns (Etsy Only)</h2><h5 id=how-can-i-contact-customer-support>How can I contact customer support?</h5><p>As a solo creator, I’ve put much effort into crafting detailed instructions within the booklet and an extensive FAQ page to answer most questions. I kindly ask that you review these resources first. If you still need help, feel free to reach out through Etsy messages. However, please note that I cannot provide support for software-related issues. For such matters, I recommend consulting the software’s help resources.</p><p>Thank you for understanding, and I’ll do my best to respond as soon as possible.</p><hr><h5 id=do-you-provide-updates-to-your-patterns>Do you provide updates to your patterns?</h5><p>As a small, independent pattern designer, I do not guarantee automatic updates to purchased patterns. While I strive for accuracy, once a pattern is purchased, there&rsquo;s no commitment to provide corrections or modifications. If significant errors are discovered, I may choose to make corrected versions available, but this is entirely at my discretion.</p><hr><h5 id=can-i-return-or-exchange-the-pattern-if-i-change-my-mind>Can I return or exchange the pattern if I change my mind?</h5><p>Unfortunately, I can’t accept returns or exchanges due to the nature of digital products.
